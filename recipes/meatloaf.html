    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 pounds extra-lean ground beef</li>
        <li>3 slices bread, toasted and crumbled</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce, divided</li>
        <li>Crème fraîche for garnishing</li>
            </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Step 2: Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook onion and garlic until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Combine onion and garlic mixture, beef, crumbled bread, crushed crackers, egg, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 can tomato sauce in a large bowl. Mix until well combined. Gradually stir in milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, until mixture is moist, but not soggy. Transfer the mixture to a 5x9 inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and continue baking 15 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Step 5: Mix the remaining tomato sauce and ketchup in a small bowl. Pour over the top of the meatloaf, and continue baking for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Step 6: Allow to cool10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche</li>
